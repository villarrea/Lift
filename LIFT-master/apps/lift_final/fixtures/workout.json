As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar a tthe chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvatur on your lower bak and sticking your chest out. This is the starting position. As you breathe out, pull up your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep elbows close to your body. After a second of squeezing your biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; where your arms are fully extended.",
